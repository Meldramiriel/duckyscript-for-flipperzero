### THIS PROJECT IS CANCELED! I MIGHT FIX IT IN THE FUTURE, WHEN I HAVE THE TIME. IN THIS STATE, IT WILL NOT WORK.

### For educational purposes only! I am not responsible for anything you do!

**Chrome Artemis** is a script built for the Ruber Ducky that collects saved passwords from a machine and emails them to your Gmail address!

What **Chrome Artemis** does:

  - Makes and exception in Windows Denfender
  - Downloads the required programs
  - Saves passwords to a .txt file
  - Email the .txt file to your Gmail account
  - Deletes downloaded programs

You can also:
  - Modify the script so it sends the .txt to a server via FTP.
  - Anything you really want


## Installation

- Open the Core folder.
- Edit Chrome.ps1 and follow the comments I've added.
- Upload the Chrome.ps1 to a file sharing service such as AnonFiles.
- Open Script.txt
- Replace "Chrome.ps1 DOWNLOAD LINK HERE" with your MediaFire Download link for Chrome.ps1. Keep the "".
- Save your .txt and encode it for Rubber Ducky.
- Put the encoded .bin on your Ducky!

You don't need Twin Duck! All files are downloaded from the web. Just modify and encode the **Script.txt** and drop the encoded .bin to your Ducky!


## Usage

Just plug in the Rubber Ducky and wait. After the script runs, it'll lock the user's screen and delete the downloaded files.
