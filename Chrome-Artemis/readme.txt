CHROME ARTEMIS v3 - Updated

INFO: I've updated the script since Mediafire keeps on deleting my link.

Hey!
Thank you for downloading my script :)

Instructions:

1. Edit Chrome.ps1 and follow the comments I've added.
2. Upload the Chrome.ps1 to a file sharing service such as AnonFiles.
3. Open Script.txt
4. Replace "Chrome.ps1 DOWNLOAD LINK HERE" with your link for Chrome.ps1. Keep the "".
5. Save your .txt and encode it for Rubber Ducky.
6. Put the encoded .bin on your Ducky!

This version should work.
